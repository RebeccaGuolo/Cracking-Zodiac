# Cracking-Zodiac
## This project examines Zodiac's cryptograms through Python attempting to find out some if the killer left purposely some hidden hints about his identity.

The work begins with an introduction about Zodiac and his cryptic messages, which are shown together with their resolutions. Data cleaning follows using NLP; afterwards linguistic analyses are carried out and graphically visualized, such as Pos-Tagging and Sentiment Analysis. It ends analysing the words that sound strange in the decryption in order to suppose the identity of the killer.

The analyses's explanations are in italian.
